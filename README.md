# Weather_API

## Description

For this project, I have created a daily work calendar that displays the work hours of 9 AM to 5 PM. The calender contains time blocks for each hour of the workday. If the hour has passed in the day, the time block is gray. For the current hour, the time block is red. If the time block hour has not occurred yet, then the timeblock is the color green.

The user is able to add text in each time block to add important agenda items. This is then saved into local storage for the day.

The project has been deployed at a live URL. To access the live URL, please click here [Weather_Api](https://alexhstrickland.github.io/Weather_API/).
